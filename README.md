create two new components : userinput and useroutput.
userinput should hold an element, useroutput two paragraphs.
output multiple useroutput componenets in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice).
Pass a username (of your choice) to useroutput via props and display it there.
add state to the app component(=>username)and pass the username to the output component.
add a method to manipulate the  state(=> an event-handler method).
pass the event-handler method refernce to the user-input component and bind it to the input-change event.
ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username pass to the useroutput.
add two way binding to your input (in userinput) to also display the starting username.
add styling of your choice to your components/elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets.
